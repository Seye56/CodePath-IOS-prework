## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
The three of my favourite apps include:
1. Duolingo
    a. I love that the app icon changes with your progress
    b. I love that the app has colorful schemes

2. Snap Chat
    a. I love that the app i con can be selected and customized from a series of choices
    b. I love the unique chat system of deleting messages
    c. I love the addition of a camera  and filters.

3. Whatsapp
    a. I  love the customizable background both chat wide and in individual chats
    b. I love the status function it has.

I would like to add to the whatapp app idea. Its a great and  innovative app  that is used world wide. I would love to add a sort of movie watch function, so that friends  and family can have an even closer time. I would also like to add like a classroom sort of functionn that includes a presenter and a board-like space where the presenter can write. This can greatly help with online study groups and meetings.

## Notes

Trying to figure out where everything was. Besidees that  there was nothing too difficult
